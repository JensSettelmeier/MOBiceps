MOBiceps is a collection of python functions for omics and mass spectrometry data. It is the working arm of the graphical user interface [MOAgent](https://github.com/JensSettelmeier/MOAgent). An early version of its core function featureSelector.py was first time applied in the work [Nature Communications, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42101-z) to identify phenotype-specific proteins in myeloproliferative neoplasms (blood cancer).
